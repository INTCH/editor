#Â CONTRIBUTING

The PlayCanvas Editor is not open source. However, the [PlayCanvas Engine](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine) _is_ open source and we encourage you to check out that project.

To help us improve the Editor, we encourage you to submit bug reports and feature requests [here](https://github.com/playcanvas/editor/issues).
